# Area-of-Patrol

About
This is a simple script that will set a RP area when a command is entered (see image). Note this script is not yet 100% finished. Currently there is no permission system with it but I will add soon.

Usage / Common Commands
/aoplist - Displays a list of all the scripts commands
/pton, /ptoff - On / Off for Peace time
/aopvote - Sends a message for players to vote for a RP area. Note; this is not recorded its just a message output
/aop[District Eg; state, sandy, ls, bc etc.]

Requirements
None this is a standalone script as with all my resources.
